# Terraforming PKS GCP

This Repo is based on  [https://github.com/pivotal-cf/terraforming-gcp](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/terraforming-gcp). and the work at (https://github.com/making/terraforming-pks-gcp).  The Concourse Pipline work has been completed and modified to keep from having to download a 3GB file locally to then just send it back up.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites can all installed on your local system via brew, so if you don't have brew....go get it.   Your system needs the `gcloud` cli, as well as `terraform`,  `gettext`, and of course, `Docker`:

```bash
brew update
brew install Caskroom/cask/google-cloud-sdk
brew install terraform
brew install gettext
```

### Service Account

You will need a key file for your service account to allow terraform to deploy resources. If you don't have one, you can create a service account and a key for it:

```
export PROJECT_ID=XXXXXXXX
export ACCOUNT_NAME=YYYYYYYY
gcloud iam service-accounts create ${ACCOUNT_NAME} --display-name "PKS Account"
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create "terraform.key.json" --iam-account "${ACCOUNT_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member "serviceAccount:${ACCOUNT_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role 'roles/owner'
```


### Var File

I have tried to limit the number of variables you are required to provide to get going.  Just fill in the variables in the text file called  `variables.txt` that's located in the `ci` subdirectory of the project.   

```
### Var Details
PIVNET_API_TOKEN: This is the new style UAA API Token (Refresh token) from your Pivnet Profile
TERRAFORM_BUCKET: This is the name of a versioned bucket.  You can pre-create it, or the system will create it for you.
GCP_PROJECT_ID: Your GCP Project name
GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH: The fully qualified path to a JSON Key with Owner privileges for your GCP account.  
PKS_CLI_USERNAME: A username for use in PKS CLI. (No underscores)
PKS_CLI_PASSWORD: Password for the CLI User
```
## Running

Note: please make sure you have populated the `variables.txt` file above as mentioned.

### Standing up environment

From the `./ci` subdirectory:
```
./run-pipeline.sh
```

### Monitoring Progress

The script will launch multiple containers and bring up a Concourse instance and the load and start the pipeline.   After a few seconds, the script will complete and show a URL to access the pipeline within Concourse.

Username:  concourse
Password:  password

The Last Step of the Pipeline, SHOW-NEXT-INSTRUCTIONS, has a task that displays the procedures for creating a K8S cluster.   You should be able to cut and past from that screen.



### Tearing down environment

To tear down the installation, simply trigger the wipe-env task.   There might be a few cluster specific things to clean up.  If the task fails, you can clean those things up manually and then trigger it again.
